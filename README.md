## Topic
We would like to build an online message-in-a-bottle platform similar to [paperplanes.world](https://paperplanes.world/).

Essentially, users will be able to place short messages inside virtual bottles. Users can retrieve a bottle at random, read the message contained inside, and add their own message. This is interesting because it's a platform that can connect people all over the world.

Ideally we'd like to implement some cool visualizations to make the platform look aesthetic (explore tools like three.js).

Our data sources will be the user-inputted messages, but other ways we could incorporate existing data sources could be scraping text from popular sites (reddit, etc) to fill initial bottles, or making the 'ocean' environment dependent on real-time data sources like weather.
